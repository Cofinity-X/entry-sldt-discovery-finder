## 5 Deployment-view

For Deployment needed:

-   Webserver
-   Kubernetes-Cluster
-   Helm

To deploy this system, you need to use the Helm Chart in a running
Kubernetes cluster. The Helm Chart is located under
"charts/discoveryfinder". In case you don't have a running cluster, you
can set up one by yourself locally, using minikube. For further information
checkout the [readme.md](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/sldt-discovery-finder/blob/main/README.md).
